# Trajectory Tracking Test Results

## Performance Validation Framework

### Engineering Requirements
**Primary Requirement:** RMS tracking error < 30mm  
**Rationale:** Robot wheelbase is 160mm. Error <30mm represents <20% of wheelbase, ensuring safe navigation with adequate clearance margins.

**Additional Constraints:**
- Max error < 100mm (minimum safe clearance)
- All trajectories must complete successfully
- Control remains stable (no oscillations or divergence)

### Performance Prediction
**Baseline (Offline Python Simulation):**
- RMS Error: 16mm under ideal kinematics
- No sensor noise, perfect state knowledge
- Validated pure pursuit implementation

**Expected Gazebo Performance:**
- Range: 10-30mm RMS across test trajectories
- Accounts for: dynamics, odometry noise, 20Hz discretization, acceleration limits
- Based on: offline baseline, pure pursuit literature, robot constraints

## Cross-Test Performance Analysis

### RMS Error Scaling with Path Complexity

| Path Type | RMS Error | Complexity Factor |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Straight | 5.4mm | Baseline (minimal turning) |
| Hybrid | 13.8mm | 2.6x (mixed geometry) |
| S-Curve | 18.5mm | 3.4x (reversing curves) |
| Circle | 23.2mm | 4.3x (constant curvature) |

**Insight:** Error scales predictably with curvature complexity. Constant-radius paths are hardest for pure pursuit.

### Max Error Analysis

| Test | Max Error | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Straight | 10mm | Startup transient |
| Hybrid | 33mm | Sharpest curve segment |
| S-Curve | 68mm | First inflection point |
| Circle | 87mm | Initial circle entry |

**Insight:** Max errors occur at: (1) trajectory entry, (2) sharpest curvature, (3) direction reversals. All remain within safe margins.

### Mean Error (Systematic Bias)

| Test | Mean Error | Interpretation |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Straight | 4.5mm | Minimal bias |
| Circle | 14.1mm | Corner-cutting (inside) |
| S-Curve | 12.6mm | Corner-cutting (bidirectional) |
| Hybrid | 12.4mm | Corner-cutting (curves only) |

**Insight:** Positive mean on all curved paths confirms pure pursuit's geometric corner-cutting. This is expected behavior, not a bug.

### Velocity Utilization

| Test | Avg Velocity | Reduction | Reason |
|------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Straight | 0.173 m/s | 13% | Startup/end deceleration |
| Hybrid | 0.188 m/s | 6% | Mostly straight segments |
| S-Curve | 0.127 m/s | 36% | Continuous turning |
| Circle | 0.136 m/s | 32% | Constant curvature |

**Insight:** Velocity scaling (v = v_desired · cos α) reduces speed during turns. Circle/S-curve maintain high heading error → sustained velocity reduction.

## Key Strengths

✅ **Sub-centimeter accuracy on straight paths** (5.4mm RMS)  
✅ **Consistent performance across trajectory types** (all pass with margin)  
✅ **Robust to high-curvature sections** (no instability or oscillation)  
✅ **Predictable error scaling** (complexity → error relationship clear)  
✅ **Quantitative validation** (metrics prove performance, not just visual)  
✅ **Safety margins maintained** (all max errors <100mm)

---

## Performance Limitations

**Known Constraints:**
1. **Corner-Cutting:** Pure pursuit inherently cuts inside of curves (positive mean error)
2. **Constant Curvature:** Circle trajectory shows highest errors (87mm max)
3. **Velocity Reduction:** Tight turns reduce speed to 0.13 m/s (36% slower)
4. **Fixed Lookahead:** 0.30m lookahead not adaptive to curvature

**Potential Improvements:**
- Adaptive lookahead (reduce on tight curves for better tracking)
- Trapezoidal velocity profiles (smoother acceleration/deceleration)
- Hybrid controller (switch to MPC for high-curvature sections)
- Path preprocessing (detect high-curvature segments, adjust parameters)
